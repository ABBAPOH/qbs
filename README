Qbs
===
Qbs is a cross-platform build tool.
The project's homepage is http://wiki.qt.io/qbs

Supported Platforms
===================

Windows XP SP2 or later
macOS 10.7 or later
Linux (tested on Debian 6/7 and Ubuntu 13)

Building the sources requires Qt 5.6.0 or later.

Build Instructions
==================
Prerequisites:
   * Qt 5.6.0 or later
   * On Windows:
     -  MinGW or Visual Studio
   * On macOS: Xcode

The installed toolchains have to match the one Qt was compiled with.

You can build Qbs with

    cd $SOURCE_DIRECTORY
    qmake -r
    make (or mingw32-make or nmake or jom, depending on your platform)

Installation ("make install") is not needed. It is however possible, using

    make install INSTALL_ROOT=$INSTALL_DIRECTORY

You can also build Qbs for Windows using Docker on Windows 10 systems.
Switch your Docker environment to use Windows containers, then run the
following to download the Windows 10 Qbs development image:

    docker pull qtproject/qbswindowsservercore

The Dockerfile from which this image is built is located in the docker
directory of the qbs source tree, should you wish to build it yourself.

You can then use the image to perform builds and develop Qbs. For example:

    # Run a container interactively with cmd shell access,
    # mounting the current directory inside at C:\qbs
    docker run -i -v %CD%:C:\qbs -w C:\qbs qtproject/qbswindowsservercore

    # Perform a release build with a temporary container instance,
    # and copy the output artifacts to the working directory
    docker run --rm -v %CD%:C:\qbs -w C:\qbs qtproject/qbswindowsservercore cmd /c scripts\make-release-archives
